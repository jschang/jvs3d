Here is a little 3d library I wrote about 6 years ago, as an exercise.  I'm putting it here mainly to prove some ability in C++.

Currently,
library can load an AC3D file consisting of a single object as exported
via the python script currently used in Blender3D.

The delete operator on jvs3d_object has been verified to clean up after itself.
